# Qwerty Layouts

These layouts should be very straight-forward: the `1dk` is on the quote key (`'`), everything else is unchanged. No `AltGr` layer.

# Qwerty42 Layouts

*Almost* standard ANSI qwerty:

- three keys are changed to make the `1dk` smoother to use:
    - the colon key (`;:`) becomes a dedicated `1dk`;
    - the colon & semi-colon signs are moved on `shift` + comma & dot keys;
    - the `<>` signs are moved to the `LSGT` key;
- an optional `AltGr` layer for an easier access to all programming symbols (``'"=<>-+{]/~`|_\``).

These layouts can fit on only 42 keys: the 10 number keys + the 3 rows of 10 keys under them + spacebar + `AltGr`. This makes a big difference in typing comfort, especially on compact or ortholinear keyboards.

Probably the most efficient qwerty variant out there — and it’s usable with non-English languages.
